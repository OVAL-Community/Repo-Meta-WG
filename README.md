# Repository Metadata Working Group

The Repository Metadata Working Group was formed on May 6, 2019 at the SCAP 2.0 Developer Days. 

## Objectives

We plan to develop proposals for how OVAL & SCAP repositories might provide a common, 
automation-friendly way to identify and retrieve content.

## Members

Current Members include:

- Stephen Banghart
- Daniel Harris
- Jack Vander Pol
- David Ries
- David Waltermire

If you'd like to join us or provide feedback of any kind, please contact us via the [mailing list](https://list.nist.gov/scap-dev-content).

## Status

We are just getting started on the Initial Process (below). Help us with [1. Document Examples](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG/blob/master/1.examples.md). 

## Initial Milestones

We are considering the following initial milestones/process:

1. [Document Examples](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG/blob/master/1.examples.md)
   1. Example Repositories: list a few actual repositories that we intend our proposal to address
   2. Example Content: list a few actual content feeds/packages that we intend our proposal to address
   3. Example Stories: list a few stories we intend our proposal to support
2. Draft Metadata Requirements
   1. Content Types: identify unique content types that our proposal must support (e.g. content packages, document formats, etc.)
   2. Metadata by Content Type: for each content type, list and describe useful metadata fields
   3. Repository/Grouping Metadata: list and describe any useful repository-global or other non-content-type metadata fields
3. Create Sample Manifests
   1. Create abbreviated, sample manifests in a variety of formats subject to interest (e.g. XML, ROLIE, JSON)
   2. Discuss and select a format (or formats)
4. Assessment, Feedback, Next Steps
   1. Discuss whether we’ve more-or-less completed our work (subject to outside feedback, documentation, etc.) or… have we come to the realization that this is going to take significantly more time, work, etc.?
   2. Solicit feedback from community, repository owners, etc. (tbd)
   3. Plan next steps
