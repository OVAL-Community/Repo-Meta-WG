# Examples

This document includes examples of repositories, content and user stories that we intend 
our work to address.

These lists are not intended to be exhaustive or prioritized. They should--at least--be 
representative of the various types of sources and capabilities that our members know 
they would like to address. 

So... if there's something you want this project to address and there's
nothing like it on these lists... please tell us via the mailing list!


## Example Repositories

Examples of actual SCAP repositories that we intend our proposal to address:

- [OVAL Repository](https://oval.cisecurity.org/)
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- DISA STIG Repository


## Example Content

Examples actual SCAP content feeds/packages that we intend our proposal to address:

- [NVD JSON/XML Vulnerability Feeds](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds)
- [NVD CPE Dictionary](https://nvd.nist.gov/Products/CPE)


## Example Stories

Examples of user stories we intend our proposal to support:

- Single Known Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * The user knows what singular piece (or pieces) of content they need, and are searching the repository to find it. They will download it once, and only rarely (if ever) seek to redownload or update later.
  * To support this story, our proposal needs to contain information that serves to identify unique pieces of content, and to make it possible for tools to search for this information.
  
- Many Known Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * Same as above, but user is looking for a large group of content (Maybe packaged into an archive, maybe not)
  * Might not imply any additional requirements, beyond containing information that supports a batch search or batch download
  
- Unknown Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * The user is simply browsing the repository with some criteria in mind, but without a known concrete piece of content.
  * To support this story, our proposal needs parsable (by human or tool) and meaningful metadata that can be browsed freely


- Single Known Content/Frequent or Automated Access
  * The user knows what singular piece (or pieces) of content they need, and are searching the repository to find it. The user needs this content to be up to date, and will frequently download or check for updates
  
- Many Known Content/Frequent or Automated Access
  * Same as above, but user is looking for a large group of content (Maybe packaged into an archive, maybe not)
