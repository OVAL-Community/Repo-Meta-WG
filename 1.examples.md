# Examples

This document includes examples of repositories, content and user stories that we intend 
our work to address.

These lists are not intended to be exhaustive or prioritized. They should--at least--be 
representative of the various types of sources and capabilities that our members know 
they would like to address. 

So... if there's something you want this project to address and there's
nothing like it on these lists... please tell us via the mailing list!

## Example Stories

Examples of user stories we intend our proposal to support:

### OVAL/SCAP Automation Stories

- Automated Identification of Repository Metadata
  * Repository host organization, repository name, repository description

- Automated CVE OVAL Content Discovery
  * Identify platforms and applications covered by CVE OVAL content in repository
  * Identify CVEs and vendor advisories covered by CVE OVAL content in repository
  * Identify content source and license

- Automatied CVE OVAL Content Retrieval
  * Download SCAP .xml package with all CVE content for a single platform or platform/application
  * Download SCAP .xml package with all CVE content for specific CVE(s) and/or advisories on a single platform
  * Determine whether package has been updated since last download

- Automated XCCDF/OVAL Package Discovery
  * Discover list of available packages
  * For each package, determine:
    - Platform, application, use case
    - Title, description, author, license, version, format and packaging format
    - ID that should remain the same even as package is versioned and metedata revised

- Automated XCCDF/OVAL Package Retrieval
  * Download SCAP packages for specific platform, application, use case and/or ID
  * Determine whether package has been updated since last download

### Format-agnostic, Mechanism-agnostic Stories

- Single Known Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * The user knows what singular piece (or pieces) of content they need, and are searching the repository to find it. They will download it once, and only rarely (if ever) seek to redownload or update later.
  * To support this story, our proposal needs to contain information that serves to identify unique pieces of content, and to make it possible for tools to search for this information.
  
- Many Known Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * Same as above, but user is looking for a large group of content (Maybe packaged into an archive, maybe not)
  * Might not imply any additional requirements, beyond containing information that supports a batch search or batch download
  
- Unknown Content/Infrequent or Manual Access
  * The user is simply browsing the repository with some criteria in mind, but without a known concrete piece of content.
  * To support this story, our proposal needs parsable (by human or tool) and meaningful metadata that can be browsed freely

- Single Known Content/Frequent or Automated Access
  * The user knows what singular piece (or pieces) of content they need, and are searching the repository to find it. The user needs this content to be up to date, and will frequently download or check for updates
  
- Many Known Content/Frequent or Automated Access
  * Same as above, but user is looking for a large group of content (Maybe packaged into an archive, maybe not)
