# Metadata Requirements for Phase I

This document will itemize the types of repository content we intend to address
in [Phases I](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG) as well as the 
specfic metadata requirements for each content type.

So... if there's a type of repository content or piece of metadata that you want this 
project to address, and it's not on this page... please tell us via the mailing list!

## Content Types

"Content Types" are the principal subjects that we can retrieve metadata--things found in Phase I 
[example repositories and formats](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG/blob/master/1.examples.md).

Content Types that our proposal must support in Phase I:

- Repository
- Package: an OVAL definitions file, SCAP 1.0 Bundle or SCAP 1.2 Datastream
- _TBD_

## Metadata by Content Type

For each Content Type in the list above, itemize and describe useful metadata fields:

- _TBD_

## Repository/Grouping Metadata

List and describe any useful repository-global or other non-content-type metadata fields:

- _TBD_


## Status

This document is a work in progress!
