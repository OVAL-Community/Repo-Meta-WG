# Metadata Requirements for Phase I

This document will itemize the types of repository content we intend to address
in [Phases I](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG) as well as the 
specfic metadata requirements for each content type.

So... if there's a type of repository content or piece of metadata that you want this 
project to address, and it's not on this page... please tell us via the mailing list!

## Content Types

"Content Types" are the principal subjects about which we can retrieve metadata, i.e. things found in Phase I 
[example repositories and formats](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG/blob/master/1.examples.md).

Content Types that our proposal must support in Phase I:

- Repository: a source of OVAL/SCAP content
- Package: an OVAL definitions file, SCAP 1.0 Bundle or SCAP 1.2 Datastream

## Metadata by Content Type

For each Content Type in the list above, itemize and describe useful metadata fields:

- Repository
  - Title: the name of the repository
  - Description: a description of the repository
  - Maintainers: name and contact information for repository maintainers
- Package
  - Title: the name of the package
  - Description: a description of the package
  - Use Case: vulnerabilty, compliance, patch, inventory, or miscellaneous
  - Applicable Platform: the platform that the package content applies to
  - Coverage Scope: a brief description of the intended scope of the content coverage (e.g. OS, Application, Bulletin, CVE, STIG, etc.)
  - Source: the name of the source(s) of the content
  - License Name: the name of the license the content is published under
  - License URL: a URL to the license the content is published under
  - Package URL: the download URL for the content package
  - Package ID: an identifier assigned by the repository for this package that remains constant while package is versioned
  - References: references included in package (CVE, CCEs, etc.)
  - Format: OVAL definitions file, SCAP 1.2 Datastream, etc.
  - Last Updated Date
  - Checksum (for file integrity)

## Repository/Grouping Metadata

List and describe any useful repository-global or other non-content-type metadata fields:
