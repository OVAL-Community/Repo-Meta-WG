# Sample Manifests for Phase I

This document will include abbreviated, sample manifests in a variety of 
formats subject to interest (e.g. XML, ROLIE, JSON) that illustrate how we
might express the [Draft Metadata Requirements for Phase I](https://github.com/OVAL-Community/Repo-Meta-WG/blob/master/2.metadata.requirements.md).

So... if there's a format you'd like to see us use and it's not on this 
page... please tell us via the mailing list!
